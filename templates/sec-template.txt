X.  Security Considerations

This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
of [RFCAAAA].

The "<module-name>" YANG module defines a data model that is 
designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040]. These protocols have to
use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and
QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

-- Writable nodes section:
-- 
-- If the data model contains any writable data nodes (
-- those are all the "config true" nodes, then include
-- the following section of text:

There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

-- If the data model contains any particularly sensitive
-- data nodes, e.g., ones that might be protected by a
-- "nacm:default-deny-write" or a "nacm:default-deny-all"
-- extensions statement, then those subtrees and data nodes
-- must be listed, with an explanation of the associated
-- security risks with a focus on how they can be disruptive
-- if abused.  Otherwise, state:
-- "There are no particularly sensitive writable data nodes."

-- Readable nodes section:
--
-- If the data model contains any readable data nodes (i.e.,
-- those that are "config false" nodes, then include the
-- following section of text:

Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
notification) to these data nodes. Specifically, the following
subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
vulnerabilities:

-- If the data model contains any particularly sensitive
-- readable data nodes, e.g., ones that might be protected by a
-- "nacm:default-deny-read" or a "nacm:default-deny-all"
-- extensions statement, or if they may reveal sensitive customer
-- information or violate personal privacy laws, such as those of
-- the Euopean Union, if exposed to unauthorized parties, 
-- then those subtrees and data nodes must be listed here, along
-- with an explanation of the associated sensitivity, security, or
-- privacy concerns.
--
-- Otherwise, state:
-- "There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes."


 -- if your YANG module has defined any RPC operations
 -- describe their specific sensitivity or vulnerability.

Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control access to these operations.  Specifically,
the following operations have particular sensitivities/
vulnerabilities:

<list RPC operations and explain the reasons for the sensitivity/
 privacy concerns>

   -- if your YANG module reuses groupings from other modules and
   -- the document that specifies these groupings also
   -- includes those as data nodes, then add this text to remind
   -- the specific sensitivity or vulnerability of reused nodes.

This YANG module uses groupings from other YANG modules that
define nodes that may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
in network environments. Refer to the Security Considerations
of <RFC-insert-numbers> for information as to which nodes may
be considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.

  -- if your YANG module does not define any data nodes, then
  -- add the following text

The YANG module defines a set of identities, types, and
groupings. These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
modules. The module by itself does not expose any data nodes that
are writable, data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs. 
As such, there are no additional security issues related to 
the YANG module that need to be considered.

Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
should identify the corresponding security considerations. For
example, reusing some of these groupings will expose privacy-related
information (e.g., 'node-example').
